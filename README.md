This project will try to reproduce the paper "Query Auto-Completion for Rare Prefixes" out 2015 by Bhaskar Mitra and Nick Craswell from Microsoft. We will try to extend it where possible by looking for new, better fitting metrics and seeing how modifications may improve (or decrease) the results of the project.
